            <ul>
                <li>Initiall release - April 23, 2012</li>
                <li>Almost 16 millions weekly npm downloads</li>

                So, What is Lodash?
                It is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.
                It was initially released in 2012, so it's already 8 years old.
                As you can see, it has almost 16 million npm downloads weekly and almost 80 thousand npm dependents.
                It is one of the most commonly used libraries in JS. This means that while you may have never dealt with
                the Lodash library itself, you are probably using it indirectly all the time.
                And it has over 47 thousand stars on GitHub, people clearly love it.
                The full build will only take 24KB of memory.
                Ok, we found out that Lodash is a mature js library, extremely popular and lightweight.

            <h2>Why Lodash?</h2>
            <p>Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects,
                strings.</p>
            <p>Lodash’s modular methods are great for:</p>

                Well, Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects,
                strings. Lodash’s modular methods are great for:
                Iterating arrays, objects, & strings

            <p>Adding Lodash to a project</p>
            <p class="left small">In a browser:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs custom" data-trim>
								<script src="lodash.js"></script>

            <p class="left small">Using npm:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs custom" data-trim>

                First, let's learn about the different ways to add Lodash to your project.
                You can add it in browser by pasting script tag in your html. You can use link to files on your host.
                You can install it with npm the way we install everything with npm.
                And in Node.js, you can add Lodash like this. As you can see, there are a lot of options. You may need
                the entire library, or, for example, just a module that contains functions for working with arrays, or
                you may even require only one function you need.
                By the way, you can also use the cdn link to get a specific module or function, just like with Node.

                Lodash library has really complete Documentation. It’s well-structured and has lots of examples, it’s
                divided into next sections:
                Array, Collection, Date, Function, Lang, Math, Number, Object, Seq, String, Util, Properties, Methods.
                Lodash provides a lot of functions, following are some of them that will help in solving the most
                common challenges when dealing with javascript objects.

            <aside class="notes">
                Now, let us look at some Collection methods.
                You may have already noticed, that Lodash duplicates a lot of methods, that most browsers already
                understand without Lodash, such as forEach, map, filter. In most cases, Lodash equivalents were
                created earlier, and their current implementations are pretty smart. If Lodash notices, that browser
                already has some function, it lets browser implementation of this function do the job, otherwise, it
                uses its own implementation.
                Function _.map can be used for getting a specific property from an array of objects.
                Works with nested properties as well
                Similar useful functions: _.mapValues, _.mapKeys, _.flatMap

                Here are some Collection methods.
                Function _.find Iterates over elements of collection, returning the first element predicate returns
                truthy for.
                Similar useful functions: _.findIndex, _.some
                Function _.filter Iterates over elements of collection, returning an array of all elements predicate
                returns
                truthy for.
                For example, we want to filter the array of objects based on the profile.experience property.
                Similar useful functions: _.every
                Function _.keyBy Creates an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element
                of
                collection through the callback function.
                We can convert an array of objects into a single object having properties as the unique identifier of
                each object. This way we can easily access the object based on that unique identifier.
                Similar useful functions: _.groupBy

                Here are some Object methods.
                We can perform object manipulation with get and set functions, which speak for themselves, and we can
                check if an object has some property with has function.
                There is also toPairs function, that can turn an object into an array of pairs, and fromPairs function,
                that turns this array back into object
                Of course, Lodash deserves more than a 10 minutes talk, but that’s all we have today. I hope I’ve at
                least inspired you to look through Lodash docs once more.
